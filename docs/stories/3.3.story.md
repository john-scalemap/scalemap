# Story 3.3: Data Persistence Validation
s
## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** ScaleMap user,
**I want** confidence that my assessment data persists correctly,
**so that** I can trust the platform with my company's operational information and return to complete assessments over multiple sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Assessment progress saves automatically with real-time persistence to DynamoDB
2. User sessions maintain state across browser refreshes and return visits
3. All CRUD operations verified working end-to-end with proper data validation
4. Document processing pipeline stores files correctly and updates assessment status
5. Data integrity checks ensure no loss of user input during submission process
6. Performance meets demo requirements with <3s response times for critical operations
7. Rollback procedures established for data recovery in case of deployment issues

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 3.2 completion notes:
- Frontend-backend integration completed with live API connections at https://api.scalemap.uk
- JWT authentication system implemented with automatic token refresh
- Error handling established with retry logic and exponential backoff
- Document upload pipeline connected to S3 with processing workflow
- Real-time progress tracking connected to backend state management
- Comprehensive API client layer built with authentication and error handling

### Architecture Context

#### Database Schema and Persistence [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- **Single Table Design**: DynamoDB table `scalemap-prod` with PK/SK pattern for optimal performance
- **Entity Access Patterns**:
  - Companies: `PK: COMPANY#{companyId}`, `SK: METADATA`
  - Assessments: `PK: ASSESSMENT#{assessmentId}`, `SK: METADATA`
  - Agent Analyses: `PK: ASSESSMENT#{assessmentId}`, `SK: ANALYSIS#{agentId}#{domain}`
  - Documents: `PK: DOCUMENT#{documentId}`, `SK: METADATA`
- **Global Secondary Indexes**:
  - GSI1: User/company lookups (`GSI1PK: USER#{cognitoUserId}`)
  - GSI2: Status-based queries (`GSI2PK: STATUS#{status}`)
- **Timeline Management**: Complex timeline pause/resume logic with clarification request handling
- **Business Rules**: Maximum 3 clarification requests, 24-hour max extension, auto-timeout after 12 hours

#### Backend Architecture for Data Operations [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **DynamoDB Service**: Centralized service layer in `apps/api/src/shared/services/dynamodb-service.ts`
- **CRUD Operations**: Standardized patterns for Create, Read, Update, Delete with proper error handling
- **Eventual Consistency**: Proper handling of DynamoDB eventual consistency in read operations
- **Concurrent Updates**: Optimistic locking patterns for assessment updates
- **Error Handling**: Business-specific error types (ValidationError, BusinessError) with proper HTTP status codes
- **Performance Patterns**: Efficient query patterns using PK/SK and GSI indexes for <50ms simple queries

#### Data Models and Validation [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Shared Types**: Complete type safety using `packages/shared/src/types/`
- **Assessment Interface**: Status enum, domain responses, delivery schedule management
- **Validation Schemas**: JSON schemas in `packages/shared/src/schemas/` for request validation
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety between frontend and backend operations

#### File Structure and Testing Locations [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **API Functions**: `apps/api/src/functions/` with domain-specific organization
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/` for cross-service testing
- **Shared Services**: `apps/api/src/shared/services/` for reusable data operations
- **Test Utilities**: `apps/api/src/functions/assessment/__tests__/test-utils.ts` for test data factories
- **Frontend Integration**: `apps/web/src/lib/api/` with backend service integration

#### Performance and Monitoring Requirements [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Response Times**: API endpoints <200ms (95th percentile)
- **Database Performance**: DynamoDB with pay-per-request billing for cost optimization
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics and alerting for all AWS services
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent caching and resource right-sizing

### Testing

#### Testing Requirements [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Integration Testing**: Live AWS services with production DynamoDB, S3, and SES
- **Coverage**: 80% minimum for critical business logic, 90% target for core services
- **Test Environment**: Uses production AWS services with test data cleanup
- **Performance Testing**: <200ms API response time, <50ms database operations
- **Tools**: Jest, Supertest for API testing, AWS SDK mocking for unit tests

#### Test File Locations [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **API Integration Tests**: `apps/api/src/functions/**/__tests__/` adjacent to implementation
- **End-to-End Tests**: `tests/e2e/` for complete workflow validation
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/` for cross-service testing
- **Test Utilities**: Shared test factories and utilities in test directories

#### Specific Testing Requirements for Data Persistence
- **DynamoDB Testing**: Eventual consistency handling, error scenarios (throttling, unavailability)
- **S3 Testing**: File upload/download reliability, presigned URL generation, large file handling
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing with concurrent users, response time validation
- **Data Integrity**: Cross-service data consistency validation, backup/recovery testing
- **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, service unavailability, partial data corruption

#### Test Data Management [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Data Cleanup**: DynamoDB TTL for temporary test assessments, automated cleanup scripts
- **Unique Identifiers**: Generate unique IDs for parallel test execution
- **Realistic Data**: Use factories for consistent, industry-specific test scenarios
- **Live Service Testing**: Production AWS services with proper test data isolation
