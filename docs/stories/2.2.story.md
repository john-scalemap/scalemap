## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
- **Story 2.1.5**: Live AWS services integration completed - S3, Textract, DynamoDB operational
- **Security Foundation**: JWT validation and rate limiting implemented and tested
- **Infrastructure Ready**: Production AWS credentials configured for eu-west-1 region

### Technical Foundation from Previous Story
[Source: Story 2.1.5 completion]
- **S3 Bucket**: `scalemap-documents-prod` configured with encryption and CORS
- **Textract Integration**: AWS Textract service configured for document processing
- **DynamoDB**: Production table `scalemap-prod` with GSI configuration operational
- **Security**: Proper IAM roles and access controls implemented

### Document Processing Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture/components.md#document-processing-service]

**Document Processing Service Components:**
- **Upload Handler**: `documents/upload-handler.ts` - S3 presigned URL generation and validation
- **Process Document**: `documents/process-document.ts` - OCR and content extraction
- **Categorize Document**: `documents/categorize-document.ts` - Domain categorization logic

**File Storage Structure:**
```
S3 Bucket: scalemap-documents-prod-mvpdev
├── {companyId}/
│   ├── {assessmentId}/
│   │   ├── raw/{documentId}.{ext}          # Original uploaded files
│   │   ├── processed/{documentId}.json     # Extracted text and metadata
│   │   └── thumbnails/{documentId}.jpg     # Preview thumbnails
```

### Data Models and Storage
[Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md#documents]

**DynamoDB Document Entity Pattern:**
```typescript
interface DocumentEntity {
  PK: `ASSESSMENT#{assessmentId}`;
  SK: `DOCUMENT#{documentId}`;
  GSI1PK: `COMPANY#{companyId}`;
  GSI1SK: `DOCUMENT#{uploadedAt}`;
  EntityType: 'Document';
  Data: {
    documentId: string;
    assessmentId: string;
    companyId: string;
    metadata: {
      originalFilename: string;
      fileSize: number;
      mimeType: string;
      uploadedAt: string;
      uploadedBy: string;
    };
    storage: {
      s3Key: string;
      s3Bucket: string;
      encryptionStatus: 'encrypted';
    };
    processing: {
      status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
      extractedText?: string;
      processingErrors?: string[];
      textractJobId?: string;
    };
    categorization: {
      category?: OperationalDomain;
      confidence?: number;
      manualOverride?: boolean;
      suggestedCategories?: OperationalDomain[];
    };
  };
}
```

### File Upload and Processing Flow
[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#document-processing]

**Upload Process:**
1. Client requests presigned URL via `POST /assessments/{id}/documents/upload-url`
2. API validates authentication, file type, and generates S3 presigned URL
3. Client uploads directly to S3 using presigned URL with progress tracking
4. S3 event triggers document processing Lambda function
5. Textract processes document for text extraction (async for large files)
6. Processing results stored in DynamoDB with categorization analysis
7. WebSocket notification sent to client with processing completion

### External Service Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/external-apis.md#aws-textract-integration]

**AWS Textract Configuration:**
- **Synchronous Processing**: Documents < 5MB processed immediately
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Large documents processed via job queue
- **Supported Formats**: PDF, PNG, JPG, TIFF (as per acceptance criteria)
- **Text Extraction**: Full text with confidence scores and layout information
- **Cost Optimization**: Batch processing for multiple documents

### File Type Support and Validation
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#file-storage-processing]

**Supported File Types:**
- **PDF Documents**: Direct Textract processing
- **Microsoft Office**: DOC/DOCX, XLS/XLSX via conversion to PDF
- **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG for OCR processing
- **Size Limits**: 50MB max per file, 500MB total per assessment
- **Validation**: MIME type verification and file signature checking

### Security and Compliance Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-privacy-standards]

**Security Implementation:**
- **Encryption at Rest**: S3 server-side encryption (AES256)
- **Access Control**: IAM policies restricting access to company documents only
- **Input Validation**: File type, size, and content validation before processing
- **Audit Logging**: All document operations logged with user attribution
- **GDPR Compliance**: Automatic deletion after assessment completion + retention period

### Frontend Integration Points
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]

**React Components Required:**
- **DocumentUpload**: Drag-and-drop interface with progress tracking
- **DocumentPreview**: PDF and image preview capabilities
- **DocumentManager**: Document organization and categorization interface
- **UploadProgress**: Real-time upload status and error handling

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Standards:**
- **Unit Tests**: Document processing functions, validation logic, S3 operations
- **Integration Tests**: Full upload-to-processing pipeline with live AWS services
- **File Format Tests**: Validate processing for each supported file type
- **Error Scenario Tests**: Network failures, invalid files, processing errors
- **Performance Tests**: Large file uploads, concurrent processing
- **Security Tests**: Access control validation, unauthorized access prevention

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `apps/api/src/functions/documents/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `apps/api/src/services/__tests__/document-integration.test.ts`
- Frontend tests: `apps/web/src/components/documents/__tests__/`

### Cost Optimization Considerations
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#cost-optimization]

**Textract Cost Management:**
- **Batch Processing**: Group multiple documents for efficiency
- **Format Optimization**: Convert Office docs to PDF before Textract processing
- **Caching**: Store processed text to avoid reprocessing
- **Size Limits**: Enforce reasonable file sizes to control costs
