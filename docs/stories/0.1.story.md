## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.3 (Data Persistence Validation), key findings that impact this story:
- DynamoDB operations require careful handling of eventual consistency
- Assessment state management involves complex timeline tracking
- Real-time progress updates require WebSocket authentication
- Document processing pipeline integrates with multiple AWS services

### Critical Frontend Conflict Prevention
**IMPORTANT**: The existing frontend has fundamental authentication architecture mismatches that must be isolated:
- Current auth implementation has token reading, persistence, and transmission failures
- Multiple auth failure modes have created unmaintainable workarounds
- Frontend-backend disconnection issues prevent proper data flow
- **Solution**: Archive broken implementation to `apps/web-legacy/` before any new development

### Architecture Context

**Tech Stack Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Primary Database**: DynamoDB with single-table design using `scalemap-prod` table
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with AWS Cognito integration
- **File Storage**: S3 with bucket `scalemap-documents-prod-mvpdev`
- **API Architecture**: AWS Lambda functions with API Gateway
- **Cost Targets**: £1-2 OpenAI per £5-8K assessment with token optimization

**Database Schema Patterns** [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md]
- **Single Table Design**: PK/SK pattern with GSI1/GSI2 for access patterns
- **Company Entity**: `PK: COMPANY#{companyId}`, `SK: METADATA` with complete industry classification
- **Assessment Entity**: `PK: ASSESSMENT#{assessmentId}`, `SK: METADATA` with delivery schedule tracking
- **Authentication Pattern**: GSI1PK: `USER#{cognitoUserId}` for user-to-company lookups
- **Timeline Management**: Complex deliverySchedule object with pause/resume capabilities

**API Specification Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]
- **Authentication**: Bearer JWT tokens with proper validation middleware
- **Error Format**: Structured error responses with code, message, details, timestamp, requestId
- **Company Schema**: Industry classification with sector, subSector, regulatoryClassification
- **Assessment Schema**: Status enum, assessmentContext, domainResponses, activatedAgents
- **WebSocket Auth**: Token-based authentication for real-time progress updates

**Backend Architecture Patterns** [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Function Organization**: `apps/api/src/functions/` with domain-based grouping
- **Auth Middleware**: Centralized authentication validation in `shared/middleware/auth-middleware.ts`
- **Service Layer**: DynamoDB service with proper error handling and business rules
- **Error Handling**: BusinessError, ValidationError, OpenAIError with structured responses

**Frontend Integration Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **API Client**: Token management with automatic refresh and retry logic
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time progress updates with reconnection handling
- **Form Validation**: Frontend validation must match backend validation exactly

**Shared Type System** [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Assessment Types**: Located in `packages/shared/src/types/assessment.ts`
- **Company Types**: Located in `packages/shared/src/types/company.ts`
- **API Types**: Located in `packages/shared/src/types/api.ts`
- **Validation Schemas**: JSON schemas in `packages/shared/src/schemas/`
