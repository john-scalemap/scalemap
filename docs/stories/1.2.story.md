## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Monorepo structure with apps/web (Next.js) and apps/api (AWS Lambda) is operational
- DynamoDB single table design implemented with proper GSI configuration for user/company lookups
- Security infrastructure foundation established with proper environment handling
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure ready for authentication events
- Code quality standards operational (ESLint, TypeScript strict mode)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Authentication File Locations:**
- `apps/api/src/functions/auth/` - Lambda functions for authentication (login.ts, refresh-token.ts, validate-token.ts)
- `apps/api/src/functions/company/` - Company management functions (create-company.ts, get-company.ts, update-company.ts)
- `apps/api/src/shared/middleware/auth-middleware.ts` - Authentication validation middleware
- `apps/api/src/shared/services/` - Services for external APIs (SES, JWT handling)
- `apps/web/src/app/` - Next.js App Router authentication pages and flows
- `apps/web/src/components/` - React authentication components
- `apps/web/src/stores/` - Zustand state management for user sessions
- `packages/shared/src/types/` - Shared TypeScript types for user, company, and authentication

**Package Dependencies from Project Structure:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14+, React 18+, Zustand (state management), TanStack React Query (API calls)
- Backend: AWS SDK v3 (DynamoDB, SES), JWT libraries, bcrypt for password hashing
- Shared: TypeScript types for user, company, and API contracts

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

**User and Company Access Patterns:**
```
Companies:
PK: COMPANY#{companyId}
SK: METADATA
GSI1PK: USER#{cognitoUserId}  # Critical for user-to-company lookup
GSI1SK: COMPANY#{companyId}

Data: {
  name: "TechCorp Ltd",
  industry: {
    sector: "technology",
    subSector: "saas",
    regulatoryClassification: "lightly-regulated",
    specificRegulations: ["GDPR"]
  },
  businessModel: "b2b-saas",
  size: { employees: 45, contractors: 8, locations: 2 }
}
```

**User Authentication Data Model:**
- Companies linked to users via GSI1PK: USER#{cognitoUserId}
- Industry classification required for later assessment customization
- Business model and size data essential for agent analysis
- GDPR compliance fields required for data retention and deletion

### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Lambda Function Templates:**
- Standard Lambda template with auth middleware, error handling, CORS
- Authentication middleware pattern for token validation across functions
- Centralized error handling for authentication-specific errors (invalid tokens, expired sessions)
- Business error types: ValidationError, BusinessError, AuthenticationError

**Service Layer Patterns:**
- DynamoDB service for consistent user/company data access
- SES service for email verification and password reset workflows
- JWT service for token generation, validation, and refresh
- Encryption service for sensitive data handling

**Authentication Flow Architecture:**
- Registration: Lambda → Email verification → Company profile → DynamoDB storage
- Login: Credentials validation → JWT generation → Session management
- Password reset: Email workflow → Secure token → Password update
- Session management: JWT refresh tokens with secure storage

### Security Requirements
[Source: Previous story 1.1 completion notes]

**Security Infrastructure Foundation:**
- Environment variable handling established for sensitive credentials
- HTTPS enforcement patterns established across endpoints
- Error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Logging infrastructure ready for authentication event tracking

**Required Security Headers:**
- HTTPS/HSTS enforcement across all authentication endpoints
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for XSS protection
- CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts

### GDPR Compliance Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

**Data Management:**
- User consent tracking in company profile data
- Data export functionality for user requests
- Data deletion workflow that anonymizes analysis data while removing PII
- Audit logging for data access and modifications

**Data Retention:**
- User and company data: No TTL - permanent business records
- Session data: 24-hour TTL for automatic cleanup
- Email verification tokens: 1-hour TTL for security

### Testing Requirements
Based on Story 1.1 testing framework established:
- Jest testing framework operational across all packages
- Unit tests for Lambda functions in `__tests__` directories alongside function files
- Integration tests for complete authentication flows
- Frontend component testing with React Testing Library
- End-to-end testing patterns established for critical user workflows

## Testing

- **Integration Testing**: API endpoint tests with local DynamoDB for database operations
- **Frontend Testing**: React components with Testing Library and mock API responses
- **E2E Testing**: Complete authentication flows with test user accounts
- **Security Testing**: Validate token security, password hashing, and input sanitization

### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story
