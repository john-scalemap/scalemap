## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4 completion, key lessons learned:
- Testing infrastructure must be robust - previous story had test configuration issues
- Mock configuration for AWS services requires proper setup during development
- Circuit breaker patterns should be implemented for external service integrations
- Error handling patterns need standardization across Lambda functions

[Source: docs/stories/2.4.story.md#dev-agent-record]

### AWS Infrastructure Architecture
Based on the deployment architecture, ScaleMap uses serverless AWS services with Infrastructure as Code via CDK:

**Core Services:**
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions with Node.js 18.x runtime
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Single table design with GSI indexes for efficient queries
- **Amazon S3**: Document storage with encryption and lifecycle management
- **API Gateway**: REST API with CORS, authentication, and rate limiting
- **CloudWatch**: Logging, monitoring, and alerting for production observability

**Service Configuration:**
- Pay-per-request billing for cost optimization on AWS free tier
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Point-in-time recovery for data protection
- Auto-scaling with Lambda concurrency and DynamoDB throughput

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-stack, architecture/deployment-architecture.md#infrastructure-as-code]

### Database Schema Requirements
The DynamoDB table must implement single table design pattern:

**Primary Table: `scalemap-prod`**
- PK (String): Partition Key - Entity type and ID
- SK (String): Sort Key - Sub-entity type and ID
- GSI1PK/GSI1SK: Global Secondary Index 1 for user/company lookups
- GSI2PK/GSI2SK: Global Secondary Index 2 for status and time-based queries
- TTL (Number): Time-to-live for temporary records
- EntityType (String): Entity discriminator
- Data (Map): Entity-specific data
- CreatedAt/UpdatedAt (String): ISO timestamps

**Access Patterns:**
- Companies: `PK: COMPANY#{companyId}`, `SK: METADATA`
- Assessments: `PK: ASSESSMENT#{assessmentId}`, `SK: METADATA`
- Agent Analysis: `PK: ASSESSMENT#{assessmentId}`, `SK: AGENT#{agentType}`

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#dynamodb-table-design]

### Lambda Function Organization
Functions must follow the established architectural patterns:

**Function Structure:**
```
apps/api/src/functions/
├── auth/ (login.ts, refresh-token.ts, validate-token.ts)
├── company/ (create-company.ts, get-company.ts, update-company.ts)
├── assessment/ (create-assessment.ts, get-assessment.ts, update-responses.ts)
├── documents/ (upload-handler.ts, process-document.ts, categorize-document.ts)
└── shared/ (middleware, services, models, utils)
```

**Lambda Configuration:**
- Runtime: Node.js 18.x
- Memory: 512MB for API functions, 1024MB for orchestrator, 2048MB for agents
- Timeout: 30s for API, 15 minutes for orchestrator, 10 minutes for agents
- Environment variables from AWS Parameter Store for security

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#lambda-function-architecture]

### CDK Stack Configuration
The CDK deployment must create all infrastructure components:

**Required CDK Resources:**
- DynamoDB Table with GSI indexes
- Lambda Functions with proper IAM roles
- API Gateway with CORS configuration
- S3 Buckets with event triggers
- CloudWatch Log Groups with retention policies
- SQS Queues for event-driven orchestration
- IAM Roles and Policies with least privilege

**Environment Configuration:**
- Development: Local/staging environment variables
- Production: AWS Parameter Store for secrets
- Proper resource naming conventions for environment separation

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#infrastructure-as-code]

### Security and Performance Requirements
Infrastructure must meet production security and performance standards:

**Security Standards:**
- JWT token validation for all protected endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization for all API requests
- Encryption at rest (DynamoDB, S3) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Rate limiting and throttling for API protection
- Secret management via AWS Parameter Store
- Proper CORS configuration restricting origins in production

**Performance Standards:**
- API response time: <200ms (95th percentile)
- Lambda cold start optimization with appropriate memory allocation
- DynamoDB query optimization with proper indexes
- S3 document processing with appropriate lifecycle policies
