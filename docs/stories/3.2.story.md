# Story 3.2: Frontend-Backend Integration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** ScaleMap user,
**I want** all frontend interactions to work with real backend services,
**so that** my assessment submissions, document uploads, and progress tracking persist correctly between sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All Next.js mock API routes removed or redirecting to live backend Lambda functions
2. Assessment submission triggers real backend processing and data persistence to DynamoDB
3. Authentication works end-to-end with JWT tokens and proper session management
4. Document uploads successfully store files in S3 and trigger processing pipelines
5. "My Assessments" dashboard loads real data from backend with proper error states
6. Progress calculations work on actual database state rather than mock data
7. Error handling properly manages backend failures with user-friendly messaging

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The frontend-backend integration implementation demonstrates solid architectural foundation with comprehensive API client structure and proper state management. However, **critical security vulnerabilities** were identified that must be addressed before production deployment. The authentication system contains multiple high-risk patterns including circular dependencies, inconsistent token storage, and unsafe JWT parsing.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ **Critical Issues Found**
  - Multiple violations of strict TypeScript usage with `any` types
  - Circular dependency patterns violate architectural principles
  - Inconsistent error handling patterns across services
- Project Structure: ✓ **Compliant**
  - Proper domain organization and file placement
  - Consistent naming conventions followed
- Testing Strategy: ✗ **Gaps Identified**
  - Integration tests use only mocks, no live backend verification
  - Missing edge case coverage for token refresh scenarios
- All ACs Met: ✓ **Functionally Complete**
  - All acceptance criteria technically implemented
  - End-to-end flows operational but with security concerns

### Security Review

**CRITICAL SECURITY FINDINGS:**

1. **Circular Dependency Vulnerability** (`apps/web/src/lib/api/client.ts:3-12`)
   - Dynamic import pattern creates race conditions in auth token access
   - Could lead to authentication bypass in specific timing scenarios
   - **Risk Level: HIGH** - Immediate fix required

2. **Dual Token Storage Inconsistency** (`apps/web/src/stores/auth.ts:311-336`)
   - localStorage and sessionStorage used inconsistently
   - Can cause authentication state desynchronization
   - **Risk Level: HIGH** - Data integrity impact

3. **Unsafe JWT Token Parsing** (`apps/web/src/lib/api/client.ts:40-49`)
   - Manual base64 decoding without validation
   - Vulnerable to malformed token attacks
   - **Risk Level: MEDIUM** - Should use proper JWT library

4. **Duplicate Refresh Logic** (multiple locations)
   - Two different refresh implementations with different error handling
   - Inconsistent behavior under failure conditions
   - **Risk Level: MEDIUM** - Reliability concern

### Performance Considerations

**POSITIVE IMPLEMENTATIONS:**
- Proper exponential backoff retry logic implemented
- Appropriate timeout handling (30s default)
- Efficient state management with Zustand

**AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:**
- Could optimize token refresh timing (currently 5min buffer)
- Consider implementing request deduplication for simultaneous calls

### Improvements Checklist

**Security & Architecture (Must Fix):**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Refactor API client to eliminate circular dependency in auth store access
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement single source of truth for token storage (localStorage OR sessionStorage)
- [ ] **HIGH**: Replace manual JWT parsing with proper validation library (jose, jsonwebtoken)
- [ ] **HIGH**: Consolidate duplicate token refresh implementations
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add SSR-safe localStorage access patterns
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Implement proper error boundary for auth failures

**Testing & Quality:**
- [ ] Add at least one live integration test for critical auth flow
- [ ] Add edge case tests for token expiration scenarios
- [ ] Test concurrent request handling with token refresh
- [ ] Add network failure simulation tests

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] Remove all `any` types, implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns across all services
- [ ] Add JSDoc documentation for public API methods

### Files Modified During Review

**No files were modified during this review** - Critical security issues require careful refactoring that should be handled by the development team with proper testing.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/3.2-frontend-backend-integration.yml

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Critical Security Issues Must Be Addressed**

**BLOCKING ISSUES:**
1. Circular dependency in auth system (SEC-001)
2. Inconsistent token storage mechanism (SEC-002)
3. Unsafe JWT token handling (SEC-003)

The story functionally meets all acceptance criteria and demonstrates solid integration architecture. However, the security vulnerabilities present **HIGH RISK** for production deployment. These issues must be resolved before the story can be marked as "Done".

**RECOMMENDATION:** Return to InProgress status to address critical security findings. Estimated effort: 1-2 days for security fixes + testing validation.
