# Testing Strategy

## Overview

ScaleMap uses a comprehensive testing approach that ensures reliability, performance, and security across all components. Our testing strategy covers unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, and performance testing for both frontend and backend systems.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

**Scope**: Individual functions, classes, and components in isolation

**Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library, AWS SDK mocking

**Coverage Requirements**:
- **Minimum**: 80% code coverage for critical business logic
- **Target**: 90% coverage for core assessment and analysis services
- **Exception**: UI components may have lower coverage if integration tested

**Key Focus Areas**:
- Assessment data validation and transformation
- OpenAI service abstraction layer
- DynamoDB operations with proper error handling
- Business logic for domain triage and analysis
- Authentication and authorization logic

### Integration Testing

**Scope**: Service interactions with external dependencies

**Tools**: Jest, Supertest, Live AWS services, OpenAI API

**Test Environment**: Uses production AWS services with test data

**Coverage Areas**:
- AWS DynamoDB operations with eventual consistency handling
- OpenAI API integration with cost tracking and error scenarios
- S3 document upload and retrieval workflows
- SES email delivery and template rendering
- Textract document processing integration
- Cross-service communication patterns

**Known Behaviors**:
- DynamoDB eventual consistency may cause temporary read delays
- OpenAI API rate limiting requires circuit breaker testing
- S3 operations may have network latency variations

### End-to-End Testing

**Scope**: Complete user workflows from frontend to backend

**Tools**: Jest, Puppeteer/Playwright (future), API integration tests

**Test Scenarios**:
- Complete assessment creation and submission flow
- Document upload and processing pipeline
- Payment processing and assessment delivery
- Email notification delivery and tracking
- Error recovery and user feedback scenarios

### Performance Testing

**Scope**: Load testing and performance benchmarks

**Tools**: Jest performance tests, AWS CloudWatch metrics

**Performance Targets**:
- API response time: <200ms (95th percentile)
- Assessment processing: Complete within 72-hour SLA
- OpenAI cost efficiency: £1-2 per £5-8K assessment
- Database operations: <50ms for simple queries

## Testing Environments

### Development Environment

**Purpose**: Local development and rapid iteration

**Configuration**:
- Local development with live AWS services
- Test data cleanup after each test run
- Reduced timeout values for faster feedback
- Mock data factories for consistent test scenarios

### Staging Environment

**Purpose**: Pre-production validation and integration testing

**Configuration**:
- Production-like AWS infrastructure
- Full external service integration
- Automated deployment pipeline testing
- Performance baseline validation

### Production Environment

**Purpose**: Live service validation and monitoring

**Configuration**:
- Health checks and smoke tests only
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Performance metrics collection
- No destructive testing

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Strategy

**Principles**:
- Use factories for consistent, realistic test data
- Clean up test data after each test run
- Avoid hardcoded values that could conflict
- Generate unique identifiers for parallel test execution

**Assessment Test Data**:
- Industry classifications covering all business sectors
- Company stages from startup to enterprise
- Complete questionnaire responses with realistic scores
- Various document types and formats for processing tests

### Data Cleanup

**Automated Cleanup**:
- DynamoDB TTL for temporary test assessments
- S3 lifecycle policies for test documents
- Automated cleanup in CI/CD pipeline
- Local development cleanup scripts

## Continuous Integration Testing

### Automated Test Execution

**Pipeline Integration**:
- Unit tests run on every commit
- Integration tests run on develop branch merges
- Full test suite execution before production deployment
- Parallel test execution for performance optimization

**Quality Gates**:
- All tests must pass before merge
- ESLint compliance required
- Type checking must pass
- Test coverage thresholds enforced

### Test Reporting

**Metrics Collection**:
- Test execution time tracking
- Coverage percentage reporting
- Flaky test identification and remediation
- Performance regression detection

## Security Testing

### Authentication Testing

**JWT Token Validation**:
- Token expiration handling
- Invalid token scenarios
- Refresh token rotation
- Cross-request authentication consistency

### Input Validation Testing

**Security Scenarios**:
- SQL injection prevention (though using NoSQL)
- XSS prevention in user inputs
- File upload validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting enforcement testing

### API Security Testing

**Endpoint Protection**:
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Rate limiting validation
- CORS policy enforcement
- Error information disclosure prevention

## External Service Testing

### AWS Service Testing

**DynamoDB Testing**:
- Eventual consistency handling
- Error scenarios (throttling, unavailability)
- Cost optimization validation
- Performance under load

**S3 Testing**:
- File upload/download reliability
- Presigned URL generation and expiration
- Large file handling and timeouts
- Error recovery scenarios

**SES Testing**:
- Email delivery validation
- Bounce and complaint handling
- Template rendering accuracy
- Rate limiting compliance

### OpenAI Integration Testing

**API Integration**:
- Model availability and fallback scenarios
- Cost tracking accuracy and budget controls
- Rate limiting and circuit breaker functionality
- Response quality validation for assessment domains

**Cost Management Testing**:
- Token usage calculation accuracy
- Budget threshold enforcement
- Model selection optimization
- Usage analytics and reporting

## Test Maintenance

### Test Review Process

**Regular Maintenance**:
- Monthly review of flaky or slow tests
- Quarterly performance baseline updates
- Annual testing strategy review and updates
- Continuous improvement based on production issues

### Test Documentation

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Test scenarios and expected outcomes
- Test data setup and cleanup procedures
- Environment configuration requirements
- Troubleshooting guides for common test failures

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Test Environment Monitoring

**Health Checks**:
- Automated service availability checks
- Test environment performance monitoring
- External service dependency tracking
- Test data integrity validation

### Production Validation

**Deployment Validation**:
- Post-deployment smoke tests
- Critical path functionality verification
- Performance regression detection
- User experience validation

This testing strategy ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining development velocity and production reliability for the ScaleMap platform.
