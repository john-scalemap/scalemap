# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for ScaleMap, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

After reviewing the PRD requirements and technical assumptions, ScaleMap has unique architectural needs that don't align well with standard fullstack templates:

**Template Analysis:**
- **T3 Stack (Next.js + tRPC + Tailwind + Prisma):** Good for rapid MVP development but lacks the sophisticated agent orchestration and event-driven architecture needed for multi-agent AI coordination
- **AWS Serverless Templates:** Better alignment for scalable AI workloads but may not provide the real-time coordination needed for 72-hour delivery pipelines
- **MEAN/MERN Starters:** Traditional stacks lack the AI-first architecture and agent state management requirements

**Recommendation:** **Custom Architecture Required**

ScaleMap needs a purpose-built architecture optimizing for:
- Multi-agent AI orchestration with intelligent resource allocation
- Event-driven processing with 72-hour delivery SLA management
- Real-time progress tracking across multiple concurrent assessments
- Cost-optimized OpenAI API usage through intelligent triage
