# Sprint Change Proposal: Frontend Renaissance & Authentication Revolution
*(Updated with Backend Data Contract Requirements)*

## Issue Summary
Frontend authentication system completely broken due to fundamental architecture mismatch between frontend implementation and backend expectations. Multiple auth failure modes (token reading, persistence, transmission) have created an unmaintainable system requiring comprehensive rebuild rather than continued patching.

## Epic Impact Summary
- **Epic 1**: Story 1.2 (Authentication) requires complete replacement with backend-aligned implementation
- **Epic 3**: Stories 3.2-3.4 blocked until frontend auth foundation rebuilt
- **Epic 4-6**: All downstream epics delayed until core user flows functional

## Artifact Adjustment Needs
1. **Frontend Architecture Document** - Complete authentication section rewrite based on actual deployed backend
2. **Epic 1 Stories** - Replace Story 1.2 with Epic 0 stories
3. **Epic 3 Stories** - Modify to reflect new frontend foundation
4. **Data Models Documentation** - Ensure frontend captures all backend-required fields

## Recommended Path Forward: Epic 0 Creation

### CRITICAL DISCOVERY REQUIREMENT
**Before any implementation begins, we must audit the actual deployed backend authentication patterns AND data requirements:**

1. **Backend API Analysis** - Examine deployed Lambda functions to understand actual auth implementation
2. **Data Contract Discovery** - Map all required fields, validation rules, and data structures
3. **Authentication Flow Documentation** - Map current working backend auth patterns vs documentation
4. **Token Management Discovery** - Identify exact token formats, expiration handling, and refresh patterns
5. **API Contract Definition** - Document actual request/response patterns that work

### Epic 0: Frontend Renaissance & Authentication Revolution

#### Story 0.1: Backend Authentication & Data Contract Audit
**As a** developer rebuilding the frontend,
**I need** to understand the exact authentication patterns AND data requirements used by the deployed backend,
**so that** the new frontend perfectly aligns with proven working systems and captures all required data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Deployed Backend Analysis** - Examine actual Lambda auth functions and middleware
2. **Data Schema Discovery** - Map all required fields for user registration, company profiles, assessments
3. **Validation Rules Documentation** - Identify backend validation requirements and error patterns
4. **Working API Pattern Documentation** - Map successful authentication flows currently in use
5. **Token Format Discovery** - Document exact JWT structure, claims, and validation patterns
6. **Request/Response Mapping** - Define precise headers, body formats, and error responses
7. **Authentication Contract** - Create definitive frontend-backend integration specification
8. **Data Contract Definition** - Document all required fields, formats, and validation rules
9. **Gap Analysis** - Identify any deviations between documentation and deployed reality

#### Story 0.2: Clean Authentication & Data Capture Implementation
**As a** ScaleMap user,
**I want** seamless authentication and data submission that works reliably,
**so that** I can access my assessments and submit complete information without technical friction.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **JWT Token Management** - Implement exact token handling patterns from backend analysis
2. **Complete Data Field Coverage** - Ensure frontend captures ALL backend-required fields
3. **Validation Alignment** - Implement frontend validation matching backend requirements exactly
4. **API Client Alignment** - Build request patterns that match deployed backend expectations
5. **Persistent Session Handling** - Implement token storage/refresh based on backend patterns
6. **Error Handling Integration** - Handle auth and validation errors using backend-defined error codes
7. **State Management Simplification** - Clean, minimal auth state aligned with backend reality
8. **Data Integrity Assurance** - Prevent partial submissions or missing required fields

#### Story 0.3: Production Integration & Data Flow Validation
**As a** ScaleMap system,
**I need** frontend authentication and data submission to work flawlessly with the deployed backend,
**so that** investor demonstrations are bulletproof and no data is lost or rejected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **End-to-End Auth Flow** - Complete user journey from registration to authenticated API calls
2. **Complete Data Submission Testing** - Validate all forms submit required data successfully
3. **Backend Validation Compliance** - Ensure no backend validation errors occur
4. **Token Persistence Validation** - Session maintenance across browser refresh and return visits
5. **Production Environment Testing** - Validation against actual deployed AWS infrastructure
6. **Error Scenario Handling** - Graceful handling of all auth and validation failure modes
7. **Data Completeness Verification** - Confirm all backend-required fields are captured
8. **Performance Optimization** - Sub-2s authentication and data submission response times

#### Story 0.4: Frontend Foundation & Data Contract Completion
**As a** developer,
**I want** a clean, maintainable frontend foundation with perfect backend alignment,
**so that** all future features build on solid, elegant architecture with zero data gaps.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Component Architecture Cleanup** - Remove broken auth components, implement clean patterns
2. **Form Architecture Optimization** - Ensure all forms capture complete backend data requirements
3. **State Management Optimization** - Minimal, efficient state aligned with backend reality
4. **Data Validation Framework** - Consistent validation patterns matching backend exactly
5. **Development Experience** - Clear, debuggable auth and data flows for ongoing development
6. **Documentation Alignment** - Update frontend docs to reflect implemented reality and data contracts
7. **Technical Debt Elimination** - Zero auth-related or data-gap workarounds or patches
8. **Data Contract Compliance** - 100% backend field coverage with proper validation

## PRD MVP Impact
**No scope reduction required** - Epic 0 accelerates MVP delivery by establishing rock-solid foundation. Authentication reliability and complete data capture directly enables investor confidence and user trust.

## High-Level Action Plan
1. **Week 1**: Backend audit & data contract definition (Story 0.1)
2. **Week 2**: Clean auth & data implementation (Stories 0.2-0.3)
3. **Week 3**: Foundation completion & validation (Story 0.4)
4. **Week 4**: Epic 3 integration and investor demo preparation

## Agent Handoff Plan
- **Backend Analysis**: Developer-led with infrastructure access and database schema review
- **Data Contract Documentation**: Backend developer + frontend architect collaboration
- **Frontend Rebuild**: Frontend specialist with backend contract and data requirements guidance
- **Integration Testing**: Full-stack validation with production environment and complete data flows
- **Documentation Updates**: Technical writer with architect review

## Success Metrics
- **100% authentication success rate** in production environment
- **Zero auth-related or data validation error tickets** post-implementation
- **100% backend data field coverage** with no missing requirements
- **Sub-2s login/session restoration** performance
- **Zero backend validation failures** from frontend submissions
- **Investor demo confidence** with zero technical anxiety

## Critical Data Gap Prevention
- **Pre-implementation audit** of all backend data requirements
- **Field-by-field validation** against deployed backend expectations
- **Complete form coverage** ensuring no required data is missed
- **Validation rule alignment** preventing submission failures

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Approve Epic 0 creation and resource allocation
2. **Sprint Planning**: Break down Story 0.1 backend and data contract analysis into specific tasks
3. **Environment Access**: Ensure development team has backend inspection and database access
4. **Timeline Integration**: Adjust Epic 3 delivery expectations based on Epic 0 completion
