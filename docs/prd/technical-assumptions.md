# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
**Rationale:** Clean architecture with domain separation (12 agentic domains, diagnostic engine, report generation, client management, agent personality system) while maintaining shared UI components and agent orchestration logic. Enables coordinated development and testing across all agent domains.

## Service Architecture
**Optimized Event-Driven Agentic Architecture:**
- **Assessment Triage Service:** Single AI call for intelligent domain prioritization and problem identification
- **Agent Pool Service:** Conditional activation of 3-5 specialist domain agents based on triage results
- **Master Orchestrator Service:** Coordinates active agents and applies Perfect Prioritization algorithm synthesis
- **Client Portal Service:** Manages authentication, file uploads, progress tracking, and full 12-agent personality UI
- **Payment & Communication Services:** Stripe integration and automated email delivery with agent attribution

**Rationale:** Optimized architecture enables parallel domain agent processing within 72-hour constraint while reducing API costs by 50-60%. Intelligent triage ensures deep expertise deployment only where critical issues exist, maintaining quality while improving efficiency.

## Testing Requirements
**Full Testing Pyramid with Agent Validation:**
- **Unit Testing:** Individual domain agent logic, personality consistency, and triage accuracy
- **Integration Testing:** Agent coordination, cross-domain analysis, and orchestrator workflows  
- **End-to-End Testing:** Complete 72-hour delivery pipeline from assessment to implementation kits
- **Agent Performance Testing:** Domain expertise accuracy and Perfect Prioritization correlation validation
- **Load Testing:** 10+ concurrent assessments with optimized agent coordination

**Rationale:** Mission-critical 72-hour delivery promise requires comprehensive testing across all agent interactions and delivery pipeline stages. Agent personality consistency and expertise accuracy directly impact brand credibility.

## Additional Technical Assumptions

**Optimized Agentic AI Infrastructure:**
- **Agent Framework:** LangGraph or similar for agent orchestration with intelligent triage and conditional activation
- **Domain Knowledge Bases:** Vector databases for each agent's specialized expertise and industry-specific knowledge
- **Agent Personality Engine:** Consistent personality traits and expertise presentation across UI (all 12 agents) and deliverables (activated agents only)
- **Smart Resource Allocation:** Pre-warmed agent contexts and token budget management for cost optimization

**AI/ML Stack Enhancement:**
- **OpenAI API + Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Optimized prompts for triage, specialist agents, and synthesis phases
- **Agent Memory Systems:** Minimal context retention with maximum insight extraction for efficiency
- **Quality Assurance AI:** Human-level QA validation layer before final delivery
- **Perfect Prioritization Algorithm:** Meta-analysis across activated domain agents with growth impact weighting

**Scalability & Performance:**
- **Intelligent Processing Concurrency:** Support for domain triage + 3-5 specialist agents + orchestrator synthesis
- **Pipeline Throughput:** 10+ concurrent assessments with optimized agent activation (30-50 active agents vs 120+ in full model)
- **Agent Response Times:** Sub-5 second individual agent interactions for real-time status updates
- **Delivery Pipeline SLA:** 72-hour guarantee with robust error handling and automatic retry logic

**Security & Compliance (Enhanced for Agent Architecture):**
- **Agent Access Controls:** Each domain agent only accesses relevant client data and knowledge bases
- **Audit Trails:** Complete visibility into triage decisions and agent activation for transparency
- **Data Isolation:** Client data segmentation across agent services with proper encryption boundaries
- **Agent Output Validation:** Automated checks for sensitive information disclosure and regulatory compliance
