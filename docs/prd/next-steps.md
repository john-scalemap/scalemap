# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Please review this PRD and create detailed UX/UI architecture for ScaleMap. Focus on:

**Core UX Challenges:**
- Design the 12-domain assessment questionnaire with smart progress tracking and industry-specific branching
- Create compelling agent personality interface showing 3-5 activated domain experts with professional credibility
- Design interactive operational health heatmaps that make complex analysis immediately actionable for busy founders
- Develop the 24/48/72-hour staged delivery experience with validation and feedback mechanisms

**Key Design Principles:**
- "Growth Bottleneck Surgery" aesthetic - precise, professional, confidence-inspiring
- Progressive disclosure managing complexity without overwhelming users
- Agent attribution system that humanizes AI analysis and builds trust
- Mobile-responsive design optimized for desktop-first business workflows

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Â£5-8K price point user experience expectations (premium, not generic)
- 72-hour delivery promise requires clear communication and expectation management
- Agent personalities must feel authentic and credible, not gimmicky
- Implementation focus - every insight connects to actionable next steps

## Architect Prompt

Please review this PRD and create comprehensive technical architecture for ScaleMap. Focus on:

**Core Technical Challenges:**
- Design optimized multi-agent architecture with intelligent domain triage (3-5 active agents vs full 12-agent deployment)
- Implement Perfect Prioritization algorithm with growth impact weighting and cross-domain dependency analysis
- Build automated 24/48/72-hour staged delivery pipeline with client validation integration
- Create scalable system supporting 10+ concurrent assessments (40+ per month) while maintaining <4 hour founder QA time

**Key Architecture Principles:**
- Event-driven microservices with robust agent orchestration and state management
- Cost-optimized AI usage through smart triage and conditional agent activation
- Enterprise-grade security (SOC2, GDPR) with comprehensive audit trails
- Automation-first design enabling solopreneur scalability

**Critical Performance Requirements:**
- 72-hour delivery SLA with 95% reliability
- Sub-3 second user interface response times
- 70% Perfect Prioritization accuracy correlation with client growth outcomes
- 50-60% reduction in OpenAI API costs vs full multi-agent approach

**Technical Risk Areas:**
- Multi-agent coordination complexity within time constraints
- OpenAI API cost and availability management at scale
- Agent personality consistency across processing and deliverables
- Cross-domain analysis accuracy and validation
