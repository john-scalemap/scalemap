## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Action

#### üî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY**
1. **External Service Account Setup**
   - **Issue**: OpenAI and Stripe account creation not documented as user responsibility
   - **Impact**: Development delays when API credentials needed
   - **Action Required**: Add user prerequisite documentation to Epic 1

2. **Domain Registration Process**
   - **Issue**: DNS/domain setup process undefined for environments
   - **Impact**: Production deployment blockers
   - **Action Required**: Define domain registration steps in infrastructure setup

#### üü° **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
3. **User Documentation Gap**
   - **Issue**: Client-facing feature documentation missing
   - **Impact**: Post-launch client success challenges
   - **Action Required**: Create user docs as pre-launch deliverable (not development blocker)

4. **Epic 5 Scope Optimization**
   - **Issue**: Some Epic 5 stories could be post-MVP
   - **Impact**: Potential timeline extension
   - **Recommendation**: Consider deferring Stories 5.2-5.4 for faster market entry

#### üü¢ **LOW PRIORITY**
5. **Credential Provision Clarity**
   - **Issue**: User vs agent responsibility boundaries unclear
   - **Impact**: Minor workflow confusion
   - **Action Required**: Clarify responsibility assignments

---

## Recommendations

### üî¥ **Must-Fix Before Development**
1. **Document External Service Prerequisites**
   - Add OpenAI account setup as user responsibility in Epic 1
   - Add Stripe account setup as user responsibility in Epic 1
   - Include API key acquisition processes

2. **Define Infrastructure Setup Process**
   - Add domain registration steps to deployment documentation
   - Include DNS configuration for dev.scalemap.com, staging.scalemap.com, scalemap.com

### üü° **Should-Fix for Quality**
1. **Clarify Responsibility Boundaries**
   - Document which credentials users provide vs agents configure
   - Specify user vs agent tasks clearly in Epic 1

2. **Optimize MVP Scope** (Optional)
   - Consider deferring Story 6.2: Client Success Tracking
   - Consider deferring Story 6.3: Business Analytics Dashboard
   - Consider deferring Story 6.4: Advanced QA Workflows
   - Keep Story 6.1: Payment Integration (essential for revenue)

### üìã **Consider for Pre-Launch**
1. **User Documentation Creation**
   - Assessment completion guides for clients
   - Results interpretation help documentation
   - Implementation kit usage instructions
   - Client troubleshooting guides

2. **User Experience Documentation**
   - Document user error scenarios and messaging
   - Create client onboarding flow specifications
