# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The platform must conduct comprehensive operational diagnostics across 12 critical domains: Strategic Alignment & Vision, Financial Management & Capital Efficiency, Revenue Engine & Growth Systems, Operational Excellence & Process Management, People & Organizational Development, Technology & Data Infrastructure, Customer Experience & Product Development, Supply Chain & Operations (if applicable), Risk Management & Compliance, External Partnerships & Ecosystem, Customer Success & Growth (CSG), and Change Management & Implementation

**FR2:** The Perfect Prioritization Algorithm must use intelligent domain triage (single AI call) to identify 3-5 critical domains requiring deep agent analysis, then deploy specialist agents only for identified problem areas, achieving 50-60% reduction in API consumption while maintaining analysis quality

**FR3:** The system must generate visual heatmap reports showing operational health with clear priority rankings for immediate vs. long-term improvements across all 12 domains

**FR4:** The platform must produce comprehensive Implementation Accelerator kits with change management playbooks, stakeholder communication templates, progress tracking dashboards, risk mitigation guides, and everything needed for successful execution without ongoing consultant support

**FR5:** The staged delivery system must automatically deliver executive summary within 24 hours, detailed reports with heatmap and validation request within 48 hours, and customized implementation kits within 72 hours based on client validation feedback

**FR6:** The system must track client implementation success rates and correlate with actual growth outcomes to validate Perfect Prioritization accuracy

**FR7:** The platform must support secure client data collection through structured diagnostic questionnaires with industry-specific branching (regulated vs non-regulated industries) and document upload capabilities

**FR8:** The system must integrate payment processing (Stripe) with proper error handling and client billing management

**FR9:** The platform must provide client portal access for deliverable download, implementation tracking, and single trusted advisor interface with background team attribution system

**FR10:** The system must generate case study data and performance metrics for founder review and business development

**FR11:** The system must deploy optimized agentic AI resources with domain expertise (3-5 active agents per assessment based on triage) to analyze user input and documentation without human intervention

**FR12:** The platform must provide transparent communication during AI processing: initial acknowledgment, next steps outline, domain triage results, and proactive outreach only if critical data gaps are identified (with timeline pause)

**FR13:** The 48-hour detailed analysis delivery must include structured validation mechanism for clients to confirm priorities, provide additional context, and guide implementation kit customization within the final 24-hour window

**FR14:** Each activated domain agent must apply industry-specific knowledge and expertise to client context, becoming a virtual domain consultant for that assessment

**FR15:** The system must include appropriate disclaimers: regulatory guidance is informational only (not legal advice), financial assessment covers organizational function only (not modeling/forecasting)

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The automated processing pipeline must consistently deliver final deliverables within 72-hour commitment with 95% reliability

**NFR2:** The Perfect Prioritization Algorithm must achieve 70% correlation between recommendations and measurable growth outcomes within 90 days

**NFR3:** User interface response times must remain under 3 seconds for all client-facing interactions

**NFR4:** The system must handle 10+ concurrent assessment processing pipelines (supporting 120+ potential agents coordinating simultaneously)

**NFR5:** The platform must maintain SOC2 compliance architecture with end-to-end encryption and proper audit trails

**NFR6:** The system must achieve GDPR compliance with data lifecycle management and user data deletion capabilities

**NFR7:** Founder time per client must remain under 4 hours total across all domain assessments and final deliverable review to prove automation effectiveness

**NFR8:** The platform must maintain 95% uptime with proper monitoring, alerting, and automated error recovery

**NFR9:** API costs (OpenAI) must remain economically viable at scale through optimized agent architecture (50-60% reduction vs full multi-agent approach)

**NFR10:** The system must support horizontal scaling to handle business growth without architectural rewrites

**NFR11:** Agent processing concurrency must support intelligent triage and 3-5 specialist agents working simultaneously per assessment

**NFR12:** Domain agent expertise must achieve consultant-level accuracy through prompt engineering and knowledge base integration rather than custom model training
