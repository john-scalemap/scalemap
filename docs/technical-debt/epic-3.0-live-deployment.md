# EPIC: Live Deployment & System Integration

**Epic ID:** 3.0
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - Blocking Investment Demo)
**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 story points (4-6 days)
**Assignee:** [Senior Developer]
**Business Stakeholder:** [Product Owner/CTO]

---

## 📋 EPIC SUMMARY

**Objective:** Deploy the ScaleMap assessment platform to live AWS infrastructure and eliminate frontend-backend disconnection issues that are preventing core user flows from functioning.

**Business Value:** Enable genuine investment-grade demonstrations with real data persistence, document uploads, and assessment submissions working end-to-end.

**Problem Statement:** Current architecture has multiple mock layers (Next.js API routes, local demo services, disconnected Lambda functions) causing core functionality failures:
- Document uploads fail due to S3 bucket mismatches
- Assessment submissions return fake data instead of calling backend
- Assessment saves don't persist to "My Assessments" dashboard
- Progress calculations work on mock state

**Solution:** Deploy unified live infrastructure and connect all frontend interactions to real backend services.

## 🚨 RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

### High Risk:
- **AWS Account Limits:** Verify account has sufficient service limits for deployment
- **Environment Variables:** Missing or incorrect configuration could break authentication
- **Data Migration:** Ensure existing demo data doesn't conflict with live deployment

### Medium Risk:
- **API Rate Limits:** OpenAI integration may hit rate limits during testing
- **Database Design:** Current schema may need adjustments for production scale
- **CORS Configuration:** Frontend-backend integration may face cross-origin issues

### Dependencies:
- **AWS Account Access:** Must have deployment permissions and proper IAM roles
- **Domain Configuration:** May need custom domain for API Gateway
- **SSL Certificates:** HTTPS required for production deployment

---

## 📅 DELIVERY TIMELINE

### Sprint Planning:
- **Day 1-2:** Infrastructure deployment and configuration (Stories 3.1)
- **Day 3-4:** Frontend integration and API connections (Story 3.2)
- **Day 5:** Data persistence validation and testing (Story 3.3)
- **Day 6:** End-to-end testing and demo preparation (Story 3.4)

### Critical Path:
Infrastructure deployment must complete before frontend integration can begin. All stories are sequential and blocking.
