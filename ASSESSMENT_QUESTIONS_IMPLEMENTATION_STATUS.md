# Assessment Questions Implementation Status

**Date:** 2025-09-16
**Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (32% Complete)
**Priority:** HIGH - Core assessment functionality incomplete

## üö® Critical Issue Summary

The ScaleMap assessment questionnaire system is **functionally working** but only contains **34 of 105 required questions** from the comprehensive assessment database. Users can complete assessments, but they're getting a shallow diagnostic instead of the comprehensive analysis the system was designed to provide.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working (Framework Complete)
- **Question display and navigation** - UI fully functional
- **Follow-up question logic** - Triggers for concerning responses (scores 4-5)
- **Industry-specific filtering** - Regulated vs non-regulated branching
- **Conditional question logic** - Cross-question dependencies
- **Auto-save functionality** - Responses persist correctly
- **Progress tracking** - Domain completion tracking works
- **API infrastructure** - Ready to handle full question set

### ‚ùå What's Missing (Content Incomplete)
- **71 main questions missing** from assessment database
- **Industry-specific questions** - Only partial implementation
- **Follow-up questions** - Only 16 of ~50+ implemented
- **Domain depth** - Most domains have 1-3 questions instead of 15-25

## Question Coverage Analysis

| Domain | Should Have | Currently Has | Completion % |
|--------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Strategic Alignment | 8 questions | 7 questions | 88% ‚úÖ |
| Financial Management | 9 questions | 7 questions | 78% ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Revenue Engine | 9 questions | 5 questions | 56% ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Operational Excellence | 8 questions | 3 questions | 38% ‚ùå |
| People & Organization | 9 questions | 3 questions | 33% ‚ùå |
| Technology & Data | 8 questions | 2 questions | 25% ‚ùå |
| Customer Experience | 8 questions | 2 questions | 25% ‚ùå |
| Supply Chain | 6 questions | 1 question | 17% ‚ùå |
| Risk & Compliance | 8 questions | 1 question | 13% ‚ùå |
| Partnerships | 7 questions | 1 question | 14% ‚ùå |
| Customer Success | 8 questions | 1 question | 13% ‚ùå |
| Change Management | 8 questions | 1 question | 13% ‚ùå |
| **TOTAL** | **105+ questions** | **34 questions** | **32%** |

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified ‚úÖ
- `/apps/web/src/app/api/assessment/questions/route.ts` - Question database API
- `/packages/shared/src/types/assessment.ts` - Question interface with follow-ups and industry-specific properties
- `/apps/web/src/services/question-service.ts` - Follow-up logic and industry filtering
- `/apps/web/src/components/assessment/questionnaire/DomainSection.tsx` - Dynamic question loading
- `/apps/web/src/components/assessment/questionnaire/QuestionCard.tsx` - Question rendering (already working)

### API Endpoints
- **GET `/api/assessment/questions`** - Returns current question set (working, needs expansion)
- **Current response:** 50 questions total (34 main + 16 follow-ups)
- **Target response:** 150+ questions total (105+ main + follow-ups)

### Data Structure (Complete & Working)
```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string;
  type: QuestionType;
  question: string;
  options?: string[];
  required: boolean;
  followUpQuestions?: Question[];  // ‚úÖ Implemented
  conditional?: {                 // ‚úÖ Implemented
    dependsOn: string;
    showIf: string[];
  };
  industrySpecific?: {            // ‚úÖ Implemented
    regulated?: boolean;
    businessModels?: string[];
    companyStages?: string[];
    minRevenue?: string;
    minEmployees?: number;
    // ... more properties
  };
}
```

## Required Work to Complete Implementation

### Priority 1: Expand Question Database (HIGH)
**Effort:** ~8-12 hours
**Task:** Add remaining 71 questions from `/content/assessment-questions-database.md`

**Action Items:**
1. Read complete assessment database (1,101 lines, 105 numbered questions)
2. Extract all questions with proper formatting for each domain:
   - Financial Management: Add 2 missing questions
   - Revenue Engine: Add 4 missing questions
   - Operational Excellence: Add 5 missing questions
   - People & Organization: Add 6 missing questions
   - Technology & Data: Add 6 missing questions
   - Customer Experience: Add 6 missing questions
   - Supply Chain: Add 5 missing questions
   - Risk & Compliance: Add 7 missing questions
   - Partnerships: Add 6 missing questions
   - Customer Success: Add 7 missing questions
   - Change Management: Add 7 missing questions

3. Update `/apps/web/src/app/api/assessment/questions/route.ts` with complete question sets
4. Ensure all industry-specific branching questions are included

### Priority 2: Complete Follow-up Questions (MEDIUM)
**Effort:** ~4-6 hours
**Task:** Add all follow-up questions for concerning responses

**Action Items:**
1. Extract follow-up question logic from assessment database
2. Add follow-up questions for scores 4-5 across all domains
3. Implement conditional logic for each follow-up
4. Test follow-up triggering in UI

### Priority 3: Industry-Specific Implementation (MEDIUM)
**Effort:** ~3-4 hours
**Task:** Complete regulated vs non-regulated question branching

**Action Items:**
1. Add all regulated industry questions (marked with "IF Regulated Industry")
2. Implement company stage filtering (startup/growth/mature)
3. Add business model specific questions (B2B/B2C/SaaS/etc.)
4. Test industry filtering logic

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] All 12 domains show appropriate number of questions (15-25 each)
- [ ] Follow-up questions appear for concerning responses (scores 4-5)
- [ ] Industry-specific questions show/hide correctly
- [ ] Question navigation and progress tracking work with expanded set
- [ ] Auto-save works with all question types
- [ ] API returns 150+ total questions

### API Testing
```bash
# Test question count
curl -s http://localhost:3003/api/assessment/questions | grep -o '"id":"[^"]*"' | wc -l
# Should return ~150+ instead of current 50

# Test specific domains have full question sets
curl -s http://localhost:3003/api/assessment/questions | jq '.["operational-excellence"] | length'
# Should return 8 instead of current 3
```

## Business Impact

### Current State Impact
- **Shallow diagnostics:** Users get basic assessment instead of comprehensive analysis
- **Missed insights:** 68% of diagnostic questions not asked
- **AI agent effectiveness reduced:** Less data for specialist agent analysis
- **Customer value compromised:** Assessment appears incomplete/basic

### Post-Completion Benefits
- **Comprehensive diagnostics:** Full 12-domain assessment depth
- **Better AI insights:** Rich data for specialist agent recommendations
- **Professional assessment experience:** Industry-leading questionnaire depth
- **Competitive differentiation:** Most thorough assessment in market

## Quick Start for Next Developer

1. **Understand current state:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/allieandjohn/scalemap
   curl -s http://localhost:3003/api/assessment/questions | grep -o '"id":"[^"]*"' | wc -l
   # Shows current question count
   ```

2. **Review source database:**
   ```bash
   head -200 /Users/allieandjohn/scalemap/content/assessment-questions-database.md
   # Shows question format and structure
   ```

3. **Start expanding questions:**
   - Open `/apps/web/src/app/api/assessment/questions/route.ts`
   - Reference `/content/assessment-questions-database.md`
   - Add missing questions domain by domain
   - Test with `npm run dev` and API calls

4. **Validate implementation:**
   - Check question counts per domain
   - Test follow-up logic with concerning responses
   - Verify industry-specific filtering works

## Notes for Implementation

- **Framework is solid** - No architectural changes needed
- **UI components work perfectly** - Just need more question data
- **Follow existing patterns** - New questions should match current structure
- **Industry branching works** - Just need to add the branching questions
- **Testing infrastructure exists** - Use existing test patterns

The hard work of building the system is done. This is primarily a **content expansion task** using the existing, working framework.
