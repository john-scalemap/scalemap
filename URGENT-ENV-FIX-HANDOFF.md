# URGENT: Environment Configuration Diagnosis & Fix Required

**Status:** CRITICAL - Blocking all development validation
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE
**Assigned:** Development Agent
**Created:** 2025-09-16
**Context:** Sprint Change Proposal from Correct-Course Analysis

## Problem Statement

End-to-end testing of v2.2 development reveals complete localhost environment failure preventing validation of implemented functionality. Despite having professionally-implemented code (Stories 1.1-2.2 marked "Done" with QA ratings of PASS/EXCELLENT), the localhost environment exhibits critical blocking issues:

### Observed Issues
1. **Homepage displays 404 error** instead of landing page
2. **Account creation fails** with network errors on form submission
3. **Login authentication fails** with network errors on credential submission
4. **Core functionality inaccessible** - cannot test questionnaire or document upload workflows

### Assessment Impact
- Zero functional testing possible
- Cannot validate 7 completed stories worth of development work
- Epic 2 progression completely blocked
- End-to-end user journey untestable

## Root Cause Hypothesis

**Evidence suggests configuration/environment issues rather than code defects:**
- QA reviews show excellent code quality across authentication (Story 1.2), health checks (Story 1.4), and core systems
- Live AWS services integrated and working (Story 2.1.5)
- Comprehensive test suites passing in development
- Professional implementation patterns throughout codebase

**Working Theory:** Localhost development environment misconfiguration preventing proper service startup and routing.

## Required Investigation Tasks

### Priority 1: Service Startup Diagnosis
```bash
# Verify all services are running
npm run dev
# Check if all expected services start (Next.js, API Gateway local, DynamoDB local, etc.)
# Identify which services are failing to start or connect
```

**Expected Services:**
- Next.js frontend (port 3000)
- API backend services
- Local DynamoDB (if used)
- Any additional microservices

### Priority 2: Homepage Routing Investigation
- **Expected:** `localhost:3000` displays landing page from `apps/web/src/app/(public)/page.tsx`
- **Actual:** 404 error
- **Check:**
  - Next.js routing configuration
  - App directory structure
  - page.tsx file existence and exports
  - Public layout loading correctly

### Priority 3: Authentication Flow Debug
- **Registration Issue:** Network errors on form submission to company profile creation
- **Login Issue:** Network errors on credential validation
- **Investigate:**
  - API endpoints responding (`/api/auth/*` routes)
  - JWT service configuration
  - Database connectivity (DynamoDB local vs production)
  - CORS configuration between frontend/backend

### Priority 4: Environment Configuration Audit
```bash
# Verify critical environment variables
echo $AWS_REGION
echo $DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
echo $S3_BUCKET_NAME
```

**Check:**
- `.env.local` file configuration
- AWS credentials and service endpoints
- Required vs optional environment variables
- Development vs production configuration conflicts

### Priority 5: Network & CORS Validation
- Check browser developer console for specific error messages
- Verify API Gateway local configuration (if used)
- Validate CORS headers for frontend-backend communication
- Test direct API endpoint access (e.g., `localhost:3001/health`)

## Expected Deliverables

### Immediate (Next 2 Hours)
1. **Service Status Report:** Which services start successfully, which fail, specific error messages
2. **Environment Audit:** Missing or misconfigured environment variables identified
3. **Quick Fixes Applied:** Any obvious configuration corrections implemented

### Short-term (Same Day)
1. **Homepage Fix:** Landing page loading correctly on `localhost:3000`
2. **Authentication Restoration:** Login/registration forms submitting without network errors
3. **Service Integration:** Frontend can communicate with backend APIs successfully

### Validation Required
Complete these manual tests to confirm resolution:

- [ ] Homepage displays landing page with system status
- [ ] User registration flow accepts form submission without errors
- [ ] Login accepts test credentials without errors
- [ ] Can navigate to questionnaire interface
- [ ] Can access document upload functionality
- [ ] Complete end-to-end user journey: Homepage → Registration → Login → Assessment → Document Upload

## Success Criteria

**Environment Operational When:**
1. All critical user paths function without network errors or 404s
2. Complete user journey testable from homepage through core features
3. All localhost services responding correctly
4. Ready for comprehensive end-to-end workflow validation

## Context for Developer

### What Works (Don't Break)
- High-quality codebase with excellent architecture
- Live AWS services integration (DynamoDB, S3, OpenAI)
- Comprehensive test suites passing
- Security implementations (JWT, rate limiting)
- Professional error handling and logging

### What Needs Diagnosis
- Localhost environment configuration
- Service startup and connectivity
- Frontend-backend communication
- Basic user journey functionality

### Development History Context
- **Epic 1:** Foundation & Authentication (Stories 1.1-1.4) - Marked Done
- **Epic 2:** Assessment Engine & Domain Intelligence (Stories 2.1, 2.1.5, 2.2) - Marked Done
- **Last Working State:** Unknown - issues have persisted through development
- **Testing Gap:** No end-to-end testing performed during development

## Files to Check First

Based on the issues, examine these files for configuration problems:

```
/package.json                     # Scripts and dependencies
/.env.local                       # Local environment variables
/apps/web/src/app/page.tsx       # Root page routing
/apps/web/src/app/(public)/page.tsx  # Landing page
/apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx     # Root layout
/turbo.json                      # Turborepo configuration
/next.config.js                  # Next.js configuration
/apps/api/src/functions/         # API endpoints
```

## Emergency Contacts

- **Project Owner:** Available for clarification on expected behavior
- **QA Evidence:** All story files contain QA reviews showing code quality
- **Architecture Docs:** `/docs/architecture/` contains implementation guidance

**URGENT: This blocks all further development progress. Please prioritize immediate diagnosis and resolution.**
